# ft_printf
A recreation of printf from the C library

ft_printf is a custom implementation of the standard C printf function, developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It supports formatted output conversion and handles a subset of standard specifiers (%c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %%). The project emphasizes low-level string manipulation, variadic functions, and adherence to standard output behavior without relying on the standard library's printf.
